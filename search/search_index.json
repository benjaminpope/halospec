This is an evolution of the idea of halo photometry as implemented in halophot for K2. Installation halospec is hosted on PyPI (though this is currently a placeholder): the easiest way to install this is with pip install halospec You can also build from source. To do so, clone the git repo, enter the directory, and run pip install . We encourage the creation of a virtual enironment to run halospec to prevent software conflicts as we keep the software up to date with the lastest version of the core packages. Use & Documentation Documentation will be found here , though this is currently a placeholder. Collaboration & Development We are always looking to collaborate and further develop this software! We have focused on flexibility and ease of development, so if you have a project you want to use halospec for, but it currently does not have the required capabilities, don't hesitate to email me and we can discuss how to implement and merge it! Similarly you can take a look at the CONTRIBUTING.md file.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#halospec","text":"Halo Spectroscopy for JWST Contributors: Benjamin Pope","title":"halospec"},{"location":"#what-is-halospec","text":"halospec - currently a placeholder - is a repository and package for halo spectroscopy of saturated sources in JWST/MIRI, using jax to implement Total Variation minimization (TV-min) by gradient descent.
